    - Notion 429 rate limit response
    - For testing retry logic

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### Testing Pyramid: 70/25/5

**Decision**: 70% unit tests, 25% integration tests, 5% E2E tests

**Rationale**:
- Unit tests are fast, reliable, and test OUR logic in isolation
- Integration tests verify WordPress compatibility without excessive overhead
- E2E tests provide smoke test coverage for critical workflows
- This ratio maximizes confidence while minimizing test maintenance burden

### Mock Everything External

**Decision**: Mock all WordPress functions (unit tests) and Notion API calls

**Rationale**:
- Tests run without network dependencies
- Tests are fast (< 2 minutes for unit suite)
- No rate limiting issues
- Deterministic test results
- Can test error scenarios easily

### Fixture-Based Notion API Testing

**Decision**: Record real Notion API responses as JSON fixtures

**Rationale**:
- Realistic test data
- Maintainable (update fixtures when API changes)
- Version controllable
- No live API credentials needed
- Can test with complex nested structures

### Use Both Brain\Monkey and WordPress Test Suite

**Decision**: Brain\Monkey for unit tests, WP Test Suite for integration

**Rationale**:
- Brain\Monkey enables fast unit tests without WordPress installation
- WP Test Suite provides real WordPress environment when needed
- Best of both worlds - speed + realism where it matters

### Coverage Goals: 75-85% Overall

**Decision**: Not aiming for 100% coverage

**Rationale**:
- 100% coverage doesn't guarantee quality
- Diminishing returns after 85%
- Focus on high-value code (95%+ on converters, media)
- Skip low-risk code (admin templates, WordPress wrappers)

### Test Organization by Type, Not Feature

**Decision**: Separate unit/integration/e2e directories

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can run fast tests separately
- PHPUnit test suites align with directory structure
- Easier to enforce test pyramid ratios

## Implementation Roadmap

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need WordPress installed to run unit tests?

**A**: No. Unit tests use Brain\Monkey to mock WordPress functions. Only integration tests require WordPress test suite.

### Q: How do I test Notion API without hitting live API?

**A**: Use fixture files in `tests/fixtures/notion-responses/`. Mock the NotionClient to return fixture data.

### Q: What if I'm changing a file that doesn't have tests?

**A**: Add tests! Use existing test files as templates. Aim for 80%+ coverage of your changes.

### Q: How do I know if my tests are good?

**A**: Good tests are:
- Fast (unit tests < 1 second each)
- Isolated (can run in any order)
- Readable (clear test names and assertions)
- Focused (test one thing per test method)
- Maintainable (easy to update when requirements change)

### Q: Should I write tests before or after code?

**A**: Either works, but tests should be included in the same PR as the feature. Test-driven development (tests first) often leads to better design.
