## How to Implement These Skills

### Option 1: Create Custom Claude Code Skills

Use the `skill-creator` skill (available in example-skills) to develop custom skills for each specialization:

```bash
# Example: Create WordPress Plugin Engineer skill
Use Skill tool with command: "skill-creator"
# Then follow prompts to create a skill with WordPress plugin expertise
```

### Option 2: Use MCP Servers

Leverage existing MCP servers or build custom ones:

- **context7** - Already available for fetching WordPress and Notion API docs
- **Custom WordPress MCP** - Could create a server with WordPress-specific tools

### Option 3: Prompt Engineering

Create detailed prompts in `.claude/commands/` for each specialization:

```bash
.claude/commands/
â”œâ”€â”€ wordpress-setup.md          # Plugin structure setup
â”œâ”€â”€ notion-api-client.md        # Notion API implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ block-converter.md          # Block conversion logic
â”œâ”€â”€ security-review.md          # Security audit
â””â”€â”€ testing-setup.md           # Test environment setup
```
