## Overview

There are three main approaches to implementing specialized expertise for this project:

### 1. Custom Skills (Recommended)

Create reusable skills using the `skill-creator` skill that can be invoked with the `Skill` tool.

**Pros:**

- Reusable across sessions
- Encapsulated expertise
- Easy to share with team

**Cons:**

- Initial setup time
- Requires planning skill structure

### 2. Slash Commands

Create `.claude/commands/*.md` files for project-specific workflows.

**Pros:**

- Quick to create
- Project-specific
- Version controlled

**Cons:**

- Less portable
- Simpler than full skills

### 3. MCP Servers

Build custom MCP servers for WordPress or Notion-specific tools.

**Pros:**

- Provides actual tools, not just prompts
- Can integrate with external services
- Very powerful

**Cons:**

- Requires Node.js/Python development
- More complex setup

---

## Creating Skills with skill-creator

### Step 1: Invoke skill-creator

```bash
# Use the Skill tool
Skill: "skill-creator"
```

### Step 2: Provide Skill Details

When prompted, provide:

1. **Skill Name**: Short, descriptive name (e.g., `wordpress-plugin-dev`)
2. **Description**: What the skill does and when to use it
3. **Expertise Areas**: List specific knowledge domains
4. **Tools Available**: What tools the skill can use
5. **Example Prompts**: Sample invocations

### Step 3: Test the Skill

```bash
# Invoke your new skill
Skill: "wordpress-plugin-dev"

# Then provide a task
"Set up the initial plugin structure for notion-wp"
```

}
```

### Settings API

```php
add_action( 'admin_init', 'notion_wp_register_settings' );

    register_setting(
        'notion_wp_options',
        'notion_wp_api_token',
        [
            'sanitize_callback' => 'sanitize_text_field',
            'default' => '',
        ]
    );
}
```

### Template 3: Block Converter Specialist Skill

```markdown
# Block Converter Specialist Skill

## Description
Expert in converting between Notion block format and WordPress Gutenberg blocks or HTML, handling 70+ Notion block types with proper structure and formatting preservation.

## When to Use
- Designing block conversion architecture
- Implementing converters for specific block types
- Handling unsupported blocks
- Creating reverse converters (WP â†’ Notion)
- Testing conversion accuracy

## Expertise Areas
- All Notion block types and structure
- WordPress Gutenberg block format
- HTML semantic structure
- Rich text annotations
- Nested block hierarchies
- Special blocks (callouts, toggles, databases)

## Available Tools
- Read, Write, Edit for converter implementation
- context7 for Gutenberg block documentation
- Bash for testing conversions

## Example Prompts

### Converter Architecture
"Design a block converter architecture with:
- Base converter interface
- Individual converters for each block type
- Converter registry
- Extensibility hooks for custom converters
- Fallback handler for unsupported blocks"

### Specific Block Conversion
"Implement a converter for Notion callout blocks to WordPress with:
- Preserve icon and color
- Convert to styled div or custom Gutenberg block
- Handle nested content
- Map Notion colors to WordPress/CSS equivalents"

### Rich Text Conversion
"Convert Notion rich text with annotations to:
- HTML with proper tags (strong, em, code, etc.)
- WordPress paragraph block with formatting
- Preserve links and colors"

## Block Type Mappings

| Notion Block | WordPress Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------------|
| paragraph | core/paragraph |
| heading_1 | core/heading (level 1) |
| heading_2 | core/heading (level 2) |
| heading_3 | core/heading (level 3) |
| bulleted_list_item | core/list (unordered) |
| numbered_list_item | core/list (ordered) |
| quote | core/quote |
| code | core/code |
| image | core/image |
| video | core/video |
| file | core/file |
| embed | core/embed |
| callout | custom block or styled div |
| toggle | core/details or custom block |
| to_do | custom block or checkbox list |
| table | core/table |
| column_list | core/columns |
| divider | core/separator |

## Conversion Challenges

### Callouts
Notion has callouts with icons and colors. WordPress doesn't have a core equivalent.

**Options:**
1. Create custom Gutenberg block
2. Use styled div with classes
3. Use core/quote with custom styling

### Toggles
Notion toggles can contain any content. WordPress has limited support.

**Options:**
1. Use HTML details/summary elements
2. Create custom Gutenberg block
3. Convert to heading with nested content

### To-Do Checkboxes
Notion to-dos are interactive. WordPress doesn't have core support.

**Options:**
1. Create custom Gutenberg block
2. Use list with checkbox HTML
3. Use paragraph with checkbox character

## Best Practices
1. Preserve semantic meaning when possible
2. Gracefully degrade unsupported features
3. Provide hooks for custom converters
4. Log conversion warnings/errors
5. Test with complex nested structures
6. Handle malformed/invalid blocks
7. Preserve as much styling as possible
8. Consider round-trip conversion (WP â†’ Notion â†’ WP)

## Using Slash Commands

Slash commands are simpler than full skills and great for project-specific workflows.

### Creating a Slash Command

1. **Create the directory:**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands
```

2. **Create a command file:**

```bash
# .claude/commands/setup-plugin.md
You are a WordPress plugin development expert. When invoked, help set up the WordPress plugin structure for notion-wp.

## Steps:
1. Create main plugin file with proper headers
2. Set up directory structure (includes/, admin/, public/)
3. Create composer.json with PSR-4 autoloading
4. Add basic activation/deactivation hooks
5. Create README.md with setup instructions

Follow WordPress Coding Standards (WPCS) and use proper sanitization and escaping.
```

3. **Use the command:**

```bash
/setup-plugin
```

## Combining Multiple Skills

For complex tasks, use multiple skills in sequence:

```bash
# Step 1: Architecture
Skill: "wordpress-architect"
"Design the overall sync engine architecture with extensibility points"

# Step 2: Notion Integration
Skill: "notion-api-expert"
"Implement the Notion data fetching based on the architecture"

# Step 3: Block Conversion
Skill: "block-mapping-expert"
"Implement block converters following the architecture"

# Step 4: Security Review
Skill: "wordpress-security-expert"
"Review all code for security issues and add necessary sanitization"

# Step 5: Testing
Skill: "wordpress-testing-expert"
"Create comprehensive tests for the sync engine"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Architecture Skills

Before implementing, use architect skills to plan structure.

### 2. Use Specific, Detailed Prompts

Instead of "set up the plugin", provide detailed requirements.

### 3. Leverage context7 for Current Docs

Always fetch latest WordPress and Notion API documentation.

### 4. Combine Skills for Complex Tasks

Use architect â†’ specialist â†’ testing workflow.

### 5. Create Project-Specific Slash Commands

For repeated workflows, create slash commands.

### 6. Build MCP Servers for Tools

If you need specific tools (e.g., WP-CLI wrapper), create MCP server.
