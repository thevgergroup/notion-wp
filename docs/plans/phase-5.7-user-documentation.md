# Phase 5.7: User Documentation & Release Preparation

**Status:** üìã Ready to Start
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH - Release Blocker
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks
**Started:** TBD
**Completed:** TBD

## Overview

Transform the plugin from developer-ready to user-ready by creating comprehensive, user-focused documentation with visual examples. This phase is a **release blocker** - the plugin cannot be submitted to WordPress.org without proper user documentation.

## Goals

1. **Rewrite README.md** - Convert from developer-focused to WordPress user-focused
2. **Create DEVELOPMENT.md** - Separate technical documentation for contributors
3. **Generate Screenshots** - Capture 7 key UI states using Playwright automation
4. **Document Feature Status** - Clear distinction between available and coming-soon features
5. **Create Installation Guide** - Step-by-step setup instructions for non-technical users

## Success Criteria

- [ ] README.md is WordPress user-focused (not developer-focused)
- [ ] README.md includes installation instructions
- [ ] README.md includes usage instructions (connect, sync, configure)
- [ ] README.md includes theme integration instructions (adding menus)
- [ ] README.md includes 7 screenshots in docs/images/
- [ ] All screenshots are properly sized (max 1200px width)
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT.md contains all technical/contributor content
- [ ] Feature status clearly documented (available vs. coming soon)
- [ ] Documentation is accessible to non-technical WordPress users
- [ ] All internal links work correctly
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are professional

## Current State Analysis

### Existing README Issues

The current README is developer-focused and includes:
- Git worktree workflow (now deprecated)
- Docker setup instructions
- Technical architecture details
- Composer/NPM build instructions
- PHPUnit testing information
- Code quality tooling

**Problems:**
- Intimidating for WordPress users
- Missing user-facing features and benefits
- No screenshots or visual guides
- Installation instructions are for developers
- No mention of WordPress.org installation

### What Users Need Instead

WordPress users need:
- What the plugin does and why they need it
- How to install it from WordPress.org (when available)
- How to connect their Notion account
- How to select and sync pages
- How to add synced content to their site
- How to troubleshoot common issues
- Visual examples of the interface

**Mitigation:**
- Test on multiple WordPress versions
- Test on multiple hosting platforms
- Include troubleshooting section
- Link to GitHub issues for edge cases

## Post-Completion

After Phase 5.7 completion:
1. Update main-plan.md to mark Phase 5 as COMPLETE
