**Twenty Twenty-Four / Twenty Twenty-Five:** ✅ Fully compatible - works in sidebars, page templates, and footer navigation

**Classic Themes:** ⚠️ Limited compatibility - works in widget areas or post content but may need custom CSS

---

## Troubleshooting

**Pattern not showing?** Sync your Notion pages first, then sync the menu (Settings → Notion Sync)

**Pattern is empty?** Make sure you've synced pages from Notion and created the navigation menu

**Navigation not hierarchical?** In Notion, organize pages as sub-pages, then re-sync

**Styling issues?** Best results with block themes like Twenty Twenty-Four. For classic themes, add custom CSS targeting `.wp-block-navigation`
