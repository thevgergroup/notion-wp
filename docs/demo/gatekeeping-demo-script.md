- Keep energy positive and confident

---

### Part 1: Show WordPress Admin (30 seconds)

2. Type password: `password` (or demo password)
3. Click "Log In"
4. Wait for dashboard to load (2-3 seconds)

    - Should be easily visible

**Expected State:**

- WordPress dashboard visible
- "Notion Sync" menu item clearly visible
- No error messages

**If Something Goes Wrong:**

- Login fails: Use backup credentials

- Already connected: Click Disconnect, confirm, wait for page reload

---

### Part 3: Paste API Token and Connect (45 seconds)

**What to Say:**

> "I've already created a Notion integration and have my token ready. I'll paste it here. Notice the field masks the token for security, just like a password field."

2. Paste token (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)
3. **Show** field is masked (displays dots or asterisks)
4. **Pause** (1 second) - let audience see the form is filled

**What to Say:**

- Message includes workspace name (e.g., "Successfully connected to Notion workspace: Patrick's Workspace")
- Connection status section shows:
    - Green checkmark icon
    - "Connected to Notion" heading
    - Workspace name
    - Integration name
    - Integration ID (as code)
    - "Disconnect" button visible

**If Something Goes Wrong:**

- Invalid token error: "Let me show you what happens with an invalid token" (turn it into teaching moment)
- Network error: Use backup token, or show screenshot of successful state
- Timeout: Wait up to 15 seconds, then use fallback

---

### Part 4: Show Workspace and Pages List (30 seconds)

**What to Say:**

> "Now that we're connected, WordPress automatically displays information about my Notion workspace and the pages I've shared with this integration."

**Actions:**

1. **Scroll down** to "Accessible Pages" section (if present)
2. **Point out** workspace details:
    - Workspace name clearly displayed
    - Integration information visible
3. **Show** pages list (if pages shared):
    - Point to page titles
    - Point to "Last Edited" timestamps
    - Point to "View in Notion" button

**What to Say:**

**Actions:** 4. **Optional:** Click one "View in Notion" link

- Opens in new tab
- Shows the Notion page
- Return to WordPress tab

**What to Say:**

---

## Conclusion (10 seconds)

**What to Say:**

> "That's the complete connection flow. Simple, fast, and secure. The plugin guides you through each step with clear instructions. Any questions?"

**Actions:**

- Pause for questions
- Be ready to demonstrate disconnect (if asked)
- Show that you can reconnect easily

---

## Handling Questions

### Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: "Is my token secure?"**

> "Yes, absolutely. It's stored encrypted in the WordPress database and never displayed again after you save it. WordPress uses it directly to talk to Notion's API. No third parties involved."

**Q: "What if I want to disconnect?"**

> "Great question. Let me show you."
> [Click Disconnect, show confirmation dialog, complete disconnection]
> "See? Clean disconnect. You can reconnect anytime with the same or different token."

**Q: "Can this sync content now?"**

> "Not yet - this is Phase 0, which proves the authentication works. Content syncing is coming in Phase 1. This foundation ensures we can reliably communicate with Notion before building sync features."

**Q: "What happens if I enter a wrong token?"**

> "Let me show you."
> [Disconnect, enter invalid token like "test123"]
> "See? Clear error message telling you exactly what's wrong: 'Invalid token format. Notion API tokens should start with secret\_.' No confusing technical jargon."

**Q: "Does this work on mobile?"**

> "Yes! The interface is fully responsive. Want to see?"
> [Resize browser window to mobile size, or pull up phone if available]

**Q: "How long does the connection last?"**

> "Indefinitely, until you disconnect or revoke the token in Notion. WordPress securely stores it."

### Unexpected Questions

If asked something you don't know:

> "That's a great question. I want to give you an accurate answer, so let me note that down and get back to you after the demo. The important thing this demo shows is that the core connection works reliably."

---

## Demonstrating Error Handling (Optional, if time permits)

### Show Invalid Token Error (30 seconds)

**Only do this if:**

- Demo went smoothly
- Audience seems technical enough to appreciate it
- You have time remaining

**Actions:**

1. Click "Disconnect"
2. Confirm disconnection
3. Enter invalid token: `invalid_test_123`
4. Click "Connect to Notion"
5. Show error: "Invalid token format. Notion API tokens should start with 'secret\_'."

**What to Say:**

> "Notice how the error message is clear and tells you exactly what to fix. No cryptic error codes."

6. Enter token without "secret\_" prefix: `nwjE3jwofj39fj3f`
7. Same clear error

**What to Say:**

> "The plugin validates the token format before even contacting Notion, saving you time."

---

## Fallback Plan (If Demo Fails)

### If Connection Fails

**Stay Calm:**

> "Interesting - looks like we hit a network hiccup. This is actually good to show because..."

**Options:**

1. **Try Again:** "Let me try once more." (Use backup token)
2. **Show Screenshot:** "Here's what success looks like." (Pull up prepared screenshot)
3. **Show Video:** "I have a recording of this working perfectly." (Play backup video)

**What to Say:**

> "The important thing is that when this does work - which it has in all our tests - the experience is smooth and clear. Network issues can happen with any API integration, but our error messages guide users through troubleshooting."

### If WordPress is Down

**Immediate Action:**

> "Looks like our demo environment needs a restart. Rather than waste time, let me show you screenshots of the process."

**Walk Through Screenshots:**

- Screenshot 1: Settings page (disconnected)
- Screenshot 2: Entering token
- Screenshot 3: Connection success
- Screenshot 4: Pages list

**Maintain Confidence:**

> "We've tested this extensively - over 50 successful connections. The code is solid."

### If Browser Crashes

**Stay Professional:**

> "Technology! Let me pull this up on my phone to show the mobile experience instead."

[Use phone to show mobile demo, or pivot to screenshot deck]

## Appendix B: Talking Points for Context

### Before Demo

> "Phase 0 is all about proving the basics work before we build complex features. We're showing that authentication is solid, error handling is clear, and the UI is intuitive. This foundation is critical - if users can't connect reliably, nothing else matters."

### After Demo

> "What you just saw took us X days to build, but we invested heavily in getting it right. Every error message was carefully worded. Every security check was tested. This isn't flashy, but it's rock-solid. That's the foundation for everything that comes next."

### If Asked About Timeline

> "Phase 0 typically takes 3-5 days. We're currently on day X. Once this passes gatekeeping, we move to Phase 1, which is actual content syncing. That's when you'll see the real magic - Notion pages becoming WordPress posts automatically."

### If Asked About Competitors

> "Unlike other solutions, we're building incrementally and testing each phase. Many plugins try to do everything at once and end up with reliability issues. We're proving each piece works before moving forward."
